turing-hs
=========

Turing Machine interpreter written in haskell during the [Meta-Rhein-Main Chaos Days 2012](http://mrmcd.net) in Darmstadt, Germany.

Turing Machine descriptions are passed to the program in the form of a config file containing a description of the transition function. A line starting with '#' is treated as a comment and ignored. A sample config file is enclosed.
