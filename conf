# Formally, a TM  is a 7-tuple, and technically we could extract the 
# information about the alphabet and the states from the function 
# table, but this is more convenient

# sample config for a turing machine specification
# This file serves the sole purpose of explaining the file format.
# The Turing machine represented by this is useless, and will loop.

# states
# By convention, the starting state is the first state in this array
["A","B"]

# alphabet
# ['⎵','b']

# the blank symbol is '⎵' by default
# the input alphabet is just the tape alphabet plus the blank symbol

# accepting states
["B"]

# ð : Alphabet x States -> (States, {L, N, R})
     ⎵             b
A   ('⎵',L,"A")   ('⎵',R,"B")
B   ('b',N,"A")   ('⎵',N,"A")
