# Formally, a TM  is a 7-tuple, and technically I could extract the 
# information about the alphabet and the states from the function 
# table, but this is more convenient


# states
# By convention, the starting state is the first state in this array
["A","B"]

# alphabet
['a','b']

# the blank symbol is '⎵' by default
# the input alphabet is just the tape alphabet plus the blank symbol

# accepting states
["B"]

# ð : Alphabet x States -> (States, {L, N, R})
     a         b
A   ('⎵',L,"A")   ('a',R,"B")
B   ('b',N,"A")   ('a',N,"A")
