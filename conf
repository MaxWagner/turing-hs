# Formally, a TM  is a 7-tuple, and technically I could extract the 
# information about the alphabet and the states from the function 
# table, but this is more convenient


# states
# By convention, the starting state is the first state in this array
["A","B"]

# alphabet
['a','b']

# the blank symbol is 'โต' by default
# the input alphabet is just the tape alphabet plus the blank symbol

# accepting states
["B"]

# รฐ : Alphabet x States -> (States, {L, N, R})
     a       b
A   (A,L)   (B,R)
B   (A,N)   (A,N)
